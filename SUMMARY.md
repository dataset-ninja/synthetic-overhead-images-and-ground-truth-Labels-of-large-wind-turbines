**Synthetic Overhead Images and Ground Truth Labels of Large Wind Turbines** is a dataset for object detection tasks. It is used in the energy industry.

The dataset consists of 441 images with 2334 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*wind turbine*).

Images in the Wind Turbines 4 dataset has bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabled image (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *train* (441 images). The dataset was released in 2020.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
