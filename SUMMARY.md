**Synthetic Overhead Images and Ground Truth Labels of Large Wind Turbines** is a dataset for object detection tasks. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the energy industry. 

The dataset consists of 441 images with 2334 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*wind turbine*).

Images in the Large Wind Turbines (by Duke Dataplus2020) dataset have bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabeled image (i.e. without annotations). There are no pre-defined <i>train/val/test</i> splits in the dataset. The dataset was released in 2020.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
