**Synthetic Overhead Images and Ground Truth Labels of Large Wind Turbines** is a dataset for an object detection task. Possible applications of the dataset could be in the energy industry. The dataset presented here is not the original one. Learn more on the dataset's homepage.

The dataset consists of 441 images with 2334 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*wind turbine*).

Images in the Large Wind Turbines (by Duke Dataplus2020) dataset have bounding box annotations. There is 1 unlabeled image (i.e. without annotations). There is 1 split in the dataset: *train* (441 images). The dataset was released in 2020.

Here is the visualized example grid with annotations:
